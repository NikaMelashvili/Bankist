# Bankist

A bank application developed using JavaScript, as per a course by Jonas Schmedtmann, heavily reliant on ES6 array methods such as map, filter, reduce, splice, slice, and find. Extensive use of chained functions showcases a comprehensive understanding of working with arrays in JavaScript. The project serves as an exemplary demonstration of my array manipulation skills. Moreover, the application utilizes the Internationalization API to provide localization-based features. Additionally, the manipulation of setTimeout and setInterval methods contributes to achieving various functionalities showcased on the hosted website.
