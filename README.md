# bankist

A bank application using JavaScript, based on a course by Jonas Schmedtmann, where most of the functionality relies on ES6 array methods such as map, filter, reduce, splice, split, and find. Chained functions are utilized extensively to achieve detailed results. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of my knowledge in working with arrays in JavaScript.
