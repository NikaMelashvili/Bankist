# bankist

A bank application using JavaScript. This 
project is from a course by Jonas Schmedtmann
where most of the functionality is based on
the ES6 array methods like map, filter, reduce,
splice, split and find. We use the chained 
functions to achive a very detailed result. 
This is an excelent project to demonstrate my
knowledge in working with arrays in javascript.
